| Create a Pull Request  | Using previous example create a pull request to add the change and associate it with the Issue                                                                          |
| Request a  Peer Review | A maintainer of the repository would then approve the change or request fixes before merging code into main branch                                                      |
| Merge in Main          | Move code into main branch                                                                                                                                              |
