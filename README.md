# Inner Source Enablement via Open Source Cookie Recipes (AKA Pull the Other One)

## Purpose of this Exercise

Show how anyone can contribute to an project using cookies recipes as the basis instead of code.

### Demo Steps (Facilitator should demo each of these in tool of choice ADO, Github, Bitbucket, Gitlab etc)

| Demo Step              | Description                                                                                                                                                             |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Create an Issue        | This shows that anyone can put in an issue which requires zero development expertise (Example: Recipe only has directions for fahrenheit could you please add celsius?) |
| Make a Change          | Update the recipe to have Celsius                                                                                                                                       |
| Create a Pull Request  | Create a pull request to add the change and associate it with the Issue                                                                                                 |
| Request a  Peer Review | A maintainer of the repository would then approve the change or request fixes before merging code into main branch                                                      |
| Merge in Main          | Move code into main branch                                                                                                                                              |

| New Issue     | There is not a gingerbread cookie recipe                                                                                                                             |
| Make a Change | Create a new branch or fork with a file called nameofcookie_recipe.md and put your recipe in it. (change nameofcookie to the name of the cookie you are documenting) |
| Pull Request  | Then submit it as a Pull Request/Merge Request                                                                                                                       |
| Peer Review   | Assign Pull Request/Merge Request to a maintainer of the project to review and approve merge into main branch                                                        |
| Merge         | Merge Code into main branch                                                                                                                                          |
